# ✅ Payment Integration - Setup Complete

## 🎯 What's Been Fixed

Your Stripe payment integration is now fully configured with:

1. ✅ **Payment Creation** - Frontend calls backend to create Stripe checkout
2. ✅ **Webhook Handler** - Receives payment events from Stripe  
3. ✅ **Policy Creation** - Automatically creates policy after successful payment
4. ✅ **Email Notifications** - Sends confirmation email to user
5. ✅ **Chat Updates** - Adds confirmation message to conversation
6. ✅ **Scripts & Docs** - Easy-to-use scripts and comprehensive guides

## 🚀 How to Use (3 Steps)

### 1. Configure Stripe Keys

Add your Stripe test keys to `.env`:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_WILL_GET_IN_STEP_2
```

Get keys from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys

### 2. Start Webhook Forwarding

This forwards Stripe events to your localhost:8000 backend:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd apps/backend
./start_stripe_webhooks.sh
```

**Windows:**
```bash
cd apps\backend
start_stripe_webhooks.bat
```

**Important:** Copy the `whsec_...` secret that appears and update `.env`

### 3. Test Payment

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Log in and get a travel insurance quote
3. Click **"Proceed to Payment"**  
4. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Complete payment
6. ✅ See confirmation in chat!

- ✅ Backend services are running
- ✅ Webhook endpoint is accessible
- ✅ Environment variables are configured

### Full End-to-End Test

1. Start backend: `cd apps/backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
2. Start frontend: `cd apps/frontend && npm run dev`
3. Start webhook forwarding: `cd apps/backend && ./start_stripe_webhooks.sh`
4. Follow "How to Use" steps above

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Issue: Webhook not receiving events

**Solution:**
1. Make sure `./start_stripe_webhooks.sh` is running
2. Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env` matches the one from Stripe CLI
3. Restart backend after updating `.env`

### Issue: Payment completes but no confirmation

**Solution:**
- Check backend logs for webhook events
- Verify payment record exists in database
- Check trip has a session_id

### Issue: Email not sending

**Solution:**
- In dev mode, emails are logged (not sent)
- Check backend logs for: `[EMAIL SERVICE] Would send email to...`
- To enable real emails, configure SMTP settings in `.env`

## ✨ What Happens After Payment

When a user completes payment, the system automatically:

1. **Updates Payment Status** → `pending` → `completed`
2. **Creates Insurance Policy** → Generates unique policy number
3. **Updates Trip Status** → `pending` → `confirmed`  
4. **Sends Email** → Confirmation with policy details
5. **Updates Chat** → Adds confirmation message to conversation

All of this happens **automatically** via the webhook handler.

## 🎓 Test Cards

For testing different scenarios:

| Card Number | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | ✅ Success |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | ❌ Declined |
| `4000 0000 0000 0341` | ⚠️ Attach succeeds, charge fails |

Use:
- **Expiry:** Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
- **CVC:** Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
- **ZIP:** Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

## 🌐 Production Deployment

For production:

1. **Use Production Stripe Keys**
   - Get from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
   - Update `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

2. **Add Production Webhook**
   - Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe`
   - Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.expired`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - Copy signing secret → update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

3. **Configure Email Service**
   - Add SMTP credentials to `.env` for real email sending
   - Test email delivery

4. **Update Payment URLs**
   ```bash
   PAYMENT_SUCCESS_URL=https://your-domain.com/payment/success
   PAYMENT_CANCEL_URL=https://your-domain.com/payment/cancel
   ```

## ✅ Status Check

Run this to verify everything is working:

```bash
cd apps/backend
./test_payment_integration.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Payment Service: Running
✅ Chat Service: Running  
✅ Webhook endpoint: Accessible
✅ Environment configured
```
