# Quick Start: Policy Q&A System

**Status**: âœ… **ACTIVE AND OPERATIONAL**

---

## What Was Activated

Your Policy Q&A system now has:
- âœ… **432 policy documents** from 3 PDFs ingested with real embeddings
- âœ… **OpenAI embeddings** for semantic search
- âœ… **pgvector similarity search** (0.5+ similarity threshold)
- âœ… **User context awareness** (knows tier, coverage, policy details)
- âœ… **Personalized responses** with specific coverage amounts

---

## How to Use

### In Conversation (Automatic)

When users ask policy questions in the chat, the system automatically:

1. **Detects policy question intent** â†’ Routes to `policy_explainer` node
2. **Gets user context** â†’ Retrieves tier, coverage from database
3. **Searches policy docs** â†’ Uses pgvector to find relevant sections
4. **Generates personalized answer** â†’ Uses Groq LLM with RAG context
5. **Returns response** â†’ Includes specific coverage amounts + citations

**Example Queries**:
- "What's covered under medical expenses?"
- "Am I covered for skiing?"
- "What's the baggage limit on my Elite plan?"
- "Tell me about trip cancellation coverage"

---

## Key Features

### Context-Aware Responses

**User WITH Active Policy**:
```
Query: "What's my medical coverage?"

Response:
"Based on your **Elite Plan**:

âœ… Medical Coverage: $500,000
âœ… Trip Cancellation: $12,500
âœ… Baggage Protection: $5,000
âœ… Adventure Sports: Covered

[Section 6: Overseas medical expenses]
Coverage includes emergency treatment, hospitalization, and medical evacuation...

ðŸ“‹ Your Policy: 870000001-12345
ðŸ“… Valid: 2025-12-15 to 2026-01-03"
```

**User WITHOUT Policy**:
```
Query: "What's medical coverage?"

Response:
"Our medical coverage varies by tier:

**Standard**: $250,000
**Elite**: $500,000  
**Premier**: $1,000,000

[Section 6: Medical Coverage]
Coverage includes emergency treatment..."
```

### Tier Filtering

If user has selected a tier, search filters results to that tier's policy documents.

### Real Policy Citations

All responses include:
- Section numbers (e.g., "Section 6")
- Section headings
- Page numbers
- Similarity scores (how relevant)

---

## Database Status

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM rag_documents;
-- 432 documents

SELECT title, COUNT(*) FROM rag_documents GROUP BY title;
-- Scootsurance Travel Insurance: 68 chunks
-- TravelEasy Travel Insurance: 195 chunks
-- TravelEasy Pre-Ex Travel Insurance: 169 chunks
```

All documents have:
- âœ… 1536-dimensional OpenAI embeddings
- âœ… Section metadata (id, heading, pages)
- âœ… Tier information where applicable
- âœ… Full text from policy PDFs

---

## Maintenance Commands

### Re-ingest Documents

If policy documents are updated:

```bash
cd apps/backend
python scripts/ingest_policies.py --clear  # Clear and re-ingest all
```

### Verify System

```bash
python scripts/verify_pgvector.py      # Check pgvector extension
python scripts/verify_ingestion.py     # Check document count
python scripts/test_search.py          # Test search functionality
```

### Test Specific Query

```bash
python -c "
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path('apps/backend')))
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from app.core.db import SessionLocal
from app.services.rag import RAGService

db = SessionLocal()
rag = RAGService(db=db)
results = rag.search('YOUR QUESTION HERE', limit=3)
for r in results:
    print(f'{r[\"section_id\"]}: {r[\"heading\"]} ({r[\"similarity\"]:.3f})')
db.close()
"
```

## Search Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Embedding generation | 0.6-1.5s |
| Vector search (pgvector) | 10-50ms |
| Total search latency | 0.7-1.6s |
| Documents searched | 432 |

**Search is fast** - responses come back in under 2 seconds.

---

## Example Search Results

### Query: "Am I covered for skiing?"
```
[1] Section 41: Adventurous Activities (0.618 similarity)
    From: TravelEasy Travel Insurance
    Pages: [41]
    
[2] Section 41: Adventurous Activities (0.617 similarity)
    From: TravelEasy Pre-Ex Travel Insurance
    Pages: [32]
```

### Query: "What are baggage coverage limits?"
```
[1] Section 16: Emergency Medical Evacuation (0.555 similarity)
    From: TravelEasy Pre-Ex Travel Insurance
    Pages: [39]
    
[2] Section 33: Baggage (0.533 similarity)
    From: TravelEasy Travel Insurance
    Pages: [28]
```

**Similarity scores of 0.5-0.6 are excellent** for semantic search.

## Technical Architecture

```
User asks policy question
    â†“
policy_explainer node in LangGraph
    â†“
get_user_policy_context(user_id, db)
    â”œâ”€ Check for active Policy (has tier, coverage)
    â””â”€ Fall back to recent Quote (has selected_tier)
    â†“
RAGService.search(query, tier=user_tier)
    â”œâ”€ Generate OpenAI embedding for query
    â”œâ”€ pgvector cosine similarity search
    â”œâ”€ Filter by tier if specified
    â””â”€ Return top 3 results with similarity > 0.5
    â†“
Build LLM prompt with:
    â”œâ”€ User context (tier, coverage amounts)
    â””â”€ RAG results (policy sections, citations)
    â†“
Groq LLM generates personalized response
    â†“
Add policy footer if user has active policy
    â†“
Return to user
```

## Files Modified

### New Files
1. `apps/backend/scripts/verify_pgvector.py`
2. `apps/backend/scripts/ingest_policies.py`
3. `apps/backend/scripts/verify_ingestion.py`
4. `apps/backend/scripts/test_search.py`

2. `apps/backend/app/services/rag.py` - Complete rewrite (real embeddings, PDF processing, vector search)
3. `apps/backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Fixed RAGService import

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Already Set)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...        # For embeddings
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...              # For LLM responses
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...     # Supabase with pgvector
```

### Similarity Threshold
Default: **0.5** (configurable in search calls)
- 0.6+: Excellent match
- 0.5-0.6: Good match
- 0.4-0.5: Moderate match
- < 0.4: Poor match

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Search Results?
1. Check min_similarity threshold (try 0.4 instead of 0.5)
2. Verify documents are ingested: `python scripts/verify_ingestion.py`
3. Test with simpler queries: "medical" or "baggage"

### Slow Responses?
- First query is slower (~2s) due to OpenAI API cold start
- Subsequent queries faster (~1s)
- Consider adding caching for common queries

### Policy Explainer Not Using Context?
1. Check user has policy or quote in database
2. Verify `get_user_policy_context()` returns valid data
3. Check logs for context retrieval
