# Chat Response Improvements

## Summary
Updated the chat generation system to remove markdown formatting and make responses more conversational and easy to read.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Helper Functions (`apps/backend/app/agents/graph.py`)

#### `clean_markdown(text: str)` 
Removes all markdown formatting from text:
- Removes bold (`**text**`, `__text__`)
- Removes italics (`*text*`, `_text_`)
- Removes headers (`### Header`)
- Removes bullet points (`* item`, `- item`, `+ item`)
- Removes horizontal rules (`---`, `***`)
- Removes code blocks and inline code
- Cleans up excessive newlines

#### `split_into_messages(text: str, max_length: int = 280)`
Splits long responses into shorter, digestible messages:
- Breaks on sentence boundaries
- Keeps each message under 280 characters (tweet-sized)
- Maintains readability by not breaking mid-sentence

### 2. Updated Response Formatting

#### Trip Confirmation Message
**Before:**
```
üìç Destination: Japan
üìÖ Travel dates: December 15, 2025 to December 22, 2025 (8 days)
üë• Travelers: 2 traveler(s) (ages: 30, 35)
```

**After:**
```
Destination: Japan
Travel dates: December 15, 2025 to December 22, 2025 (8 days)
Travelers: 2 travelers (ages: 30, 35)
```

#### Payment Success Message
**Before:**
```
üéâ Payment successful! Your policy has been created.

Policy Number: **POL-12345**

Your travel insurance is now active...
```

**After:**
```
Payment successful! Your policy has been created.

Your Policy Number is: POL-12345

Your travel insurance is now active...
```

#### Payment Link Message
**Before:**
```
Great! I've set up your payment for the **Elite** plan ($150.00 SGD).
```

**After:**
```
Great! I've set up your payment for the Elite plan ($150.00 SGD).
```

#### Quote Display
**Special case:** Plan cards KEEP their markdown formatting because the frontend parser needs it to render side-by-side UI cards:

```
üåü **Standard Plan: $120.00 SGD**
   ‚úì Medical coverage: $100,000
   ‚úì Trip cancellation: $5,000
   ‚úì Baggage protection: $3,000

‚≠ê **Elite Plan: $180.00 SGD**
   ‚úì Medical coverage: $250,000
   ‚úì Trip cancellation: $10,000
   ‚úì Adventure sports coverage included

üíé **Premier Plan: $250.00 SGD**
   ‚úì Medical coverage: $500,000
   ‚úì Trip cancellation: $20,000
   ‚úì Full adventure sports coverage
```

The frontend parses this format and renders it as 3 cards side-by-side in a grid layout.

### 3. Updated Policy Explainer System Prompt

**New Guidelines:**
1. Be specific and direct - cite exact coverage amounts
2. Use the policy sections provided above for accurate information
3. If user has a policy, personalize the answer to THEIR coverage
4. Write in a conversational, easy-to-read style
5. Break information into short, digestible sentences
6. **Avoid markdown formatting (no asterisks, headers, or bullet points)**
7. Include citations like "[Section 6: Medical Coverage]"
8. If asked about exclusions, be clear about what's NOT covered
9. If information isn't in the provided sections, say so clearly
10. **Keep responses concise - aim for 2-3 short paragraphs maximum**

### 4. Applied Selective Markdown Cleaning in Chat Router

Added smart markdown cleaning in `apps/backend/app/routers/chat.py` that preserves plan card formatting:
```python
# Clean markdown formatting, but preserve plan card formatting (frontend needs it)
# Check if response contains plan cards (has plan emojis and ** pattern)
has_plan_cards = any(emoji in agent_response for emoji in ['üåü', '‚≠ê', 'üíé']) and '**' in agent_response
if not has_plan_cards:
    agent_response = clean_markdown(agent_response)
```

This ensures most AI responses are cleaned, but **preserves the markdown formatting for plan cards** since the frontend parser depends on the `**Plan Name: $Price**` format to render the side-by-side card layout.

### 5. Updated All Response Generation Points

Removed markdown formatting from:
- Trip confirmation messages
- Payment success messages
- Payment link messages
- Quote displays
- Policy explainer responses
- Document extraction confirmations
- Claim guidance responses
- Risk analysis messages
- Error messages

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Easier to Read**: No visual clutter from markdown symbols
2. **More Natural**: Responses feel more conversational
3. **Mobile-Friendly**: Cleaner text displays better on mobile devices
4. **Faster Scanning**: Information is organized without formatting distractions

### For Developers
1. **Consistent Output**: All responses now follow the same clean format
2. **Frontend Flexibility**: Frontend can apply its own styling without conflicting with markdown
3. **Easier Testing**: Plain text responses are easier to test and validate
4. **Better Debugging**: No confusion between intended formatting and escaped characters

## Testing Recommendations

Test the following scenarios:
1. **Basic Quote Flow**: Ask for a travel insurance quote
2. **Document Upload**: Upload a flight confirmation and verify the confirmation message
3. **Policy Questions**: Ask questions about coverage to test the policy explainer
4. **Payment Flow**: Complete a payment and check the success message
5. **Long Responses**: Ask complex questions that might generate long responses

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:
1. Remove the `clean_markdown()` and `split_into_messages()` functions from `graph.py`
2. Restore markdown formatting in response templates
3. Remove the `clean_markdown()` call from `chat.py`
4. Revert the policy_explainer system prompt to include bullet points and markdown

## Notes

- The system still uses emojis in some places (like payment success and plan cards), but these are part of the text, not markdown formatting
- **Plan cards are a special case**: They retain `**bold**` markdown because the frontend parser depends on this format to identify and render the plans as side-by-side UI cards
- The clean_markdown function is selectively applied in the chat router - it skips cleaning when plan cards are detected
- Response length is not currently limited using `split_into_messages()`, but the function is available if needed in the future
- If you need to modify the plan card format, make sure to update the frontend parser in `apps/frontend/src/app/app/quote/page.tsx` accordingly
