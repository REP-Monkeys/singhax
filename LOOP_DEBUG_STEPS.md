# Debugging Loop Issue - Steps

The chatbot is looping after receiving answers. Based on investigation:

## Current State

âœ… Checkpointer is enabled and working
âœ… State merging should work with LangGraph
âœ… Routing logic looks correct

## Likely Root Cause

The backend needs to be **reloaded** to pick up the fix to `chat.py` that removed preloading logic.

## Action Required

**Restart the backend server:**

```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C if running)

# Start it again
cd apps/backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

## What Was Fixed

Changed `apps/backend/app/routers/chat.py` to:
- Remove preloading of state from checkpointer
- Let LangGraph's checkpointer handle state merging automatically
- Pass only the new message + user_id + session_id

This should fix the looping issue where questions were being repeated.

## Testing

After restart:
1. Start fresh conversation
2. Answer questions as they come
3. Bot should NOT repeat questions
4. Should progress through: destination â†’ dates â†’ travelers â†’ adventure â†’ confirmation â†’ quotes

## If Still Looping

Check backend logs for:
- `ðŸ”€ ORCHESTRATOR` routing decisions
- `intent` classification
- Which route is chosen

The logs will show where the routing is going wrong.
