## Testing Date
Started browser testing session on chat interface and enhancements.

## Bugs Identified

### BUG #1: Chat Interface Requires Authentication (Potential Issue)
**Location**: Frontend - Quote Page (`/app/quote`)
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Needs Confirmation

**Description**:
- When navigating to `http://localhost:3000/app/quote`, users are redirected to the login page
- The chat interface is protected by authentication middleware
- This prevents users from directly accessing the quote/chat interface without logging in first

**Expected Behavior**:
- Either allow anonymous access to the chat interface for demo purposes, OR
- Provide a clear path for new users to register/login before accessing chat

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/app/quote`
2. Observe redirect to login page

**Note**: This might be intentional behavior for the production system, but for a hackathon demo, allowing anonymous access might improve user experience.
