## Known Issues

### 1. OCR Service Import Error
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** OCR-dependent tests cannot run  
**Status:** Non-blocking

**Details:**
- Some tests fail to import due to `pytesseract` module dependency
- Affects: `test_chat_integration.py`, `test_payment_integration.py`
- OCR service has mock fallback in requirements.txt
- Core functionality works, just test imports affected

**Affected Tests:**
- Chat integration tests (collection error)
- Payment integration tests (collection error)

**Resolution:**
- Tests that don't require OCR imports all pass
- OCR functionality is optional for core insurance flow
- Can be resolved by installing Tesseract OCR or removing OCR dependency from test files
