   - If yes: "Have you been hospitalized in the last 12 months?"
   - If yes: "Have there been any changes to medications or treatments in the last 30 days?"
3. **Trip Type**: "Is this a single trip or do you need annual coverage?"
4. **Trip Duration**: "How long will your trip be?"
5. **Activities**: "Will you be participating in any adventure sports or high-risk activities?"
6. **Coverage Needs**: "Do you have any specific coverage requirements?"

### Decision Logic:
```
IF pre_existing_conditions:
    IF meets_pre_ex_eligibility AND trip_duration <= 30 AND single_trip:
        RECOMMEND TravelEasy Pre-Ex
    ELSE:
        RECOMMEND TravelEasy Standard (with exclusions disclosure)
        OR refer to agent if conditions are complex
ELSE:
    IF age >= 70:
        RECOMMEND TravelEasy Standard (single trip only)
    ELIF scoot_airline:
        CONSIDER Scootsurance
    ELIF annual_coverage_needed:
        RECOMMEND TravelEasy Standard (annual plan)
    ELSE:
        COMPARE Scootsurance vs TravelEasy Standard based on:
            - Coverage amounts needed
            - Plan tier (Standard/Elite/Premier)
            - Special benefits (KrisFlyer, etc.)
```

---

## Summary

The **most critical decision factor** is **pre-existing medical conditions**. This single factor determines whether a customer needs the Pre-Ex policy or can use standard policies. All other factors (age, trip type, duration) are secondary but still important for determining eligibility and coverage limits.
