# ACTION REQUIRED - Restart Backend

## The Problem
Chatbot keeps looping with "How else can I help you today?" after answering questions.

## What I Changed
- Modified `apps/backend/app/routers/chat.py` to use checkpointer properly
- Added state initialization in `orchestrator`

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Restart Backend

```bash
# In your backend terminal
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
# Then restart:
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Step 2: Test and Share Logs

1. Start a new conversation
2. Answer the questions
3. When you get to adventure sports, answer "no"
4. **Watch your backend terminal for logs**
5. **Copy the entire log output** starting from when you hit "no"
6. **Share it with me**

### Step 3: What I Need to See

Look for these patterns in the logs:

```
ðŸ”€ ORCHESTRATOR (iteration X)
Intent: <what intent?>
ðŸ”€ Routing #X: intent=<what?>
   â†’ <where does it go?>
```

**The logs will tell me exactly where the routing is failing.**

## Why This Is Needed

I can't debug routing problems without seeing:
- What intent is being classified
- What route is being chosen  
- What state the graph has
- Where the flow breaks

The backend logs have all this information. Please restart and share the logs!
