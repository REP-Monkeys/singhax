# Adventure Question Not Being Asked - Fix

## Problem
The chatbot was not prompting users with the adventure activities question, even after collecting all required information.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the **order of the conditional checks**. The logic was:

```python
if missing:
    # Ask questions...
elif prefs.get("adventure_sports") is None:  # This check came AFTER missing
    # Ask adventure...
elif all_required_present:  # This check came LAST
    # Show confirmation...
```

**What was happening:**
1. User provides all info â†’ `missing = []` â†’ first `if` FALSE
2. `adventure_sports = None` â†’ second `elif` should be TRUE
3. But `all_required_present = True` â†’ third `elif` would also be TRUE!
4. In elif chains, the **first matching condition wins**
5. But the issue was that after collecting all info, `missing` was empty, so the flow went to ask about missing fields, then skipped to confirmation

Actually, looking closer, the real issue was that when `missing = []` (all required fields collected), the condition `elif all_required_present` would match FIRST and set the default before the adventure question could be asked.

Wait, that's not right either. Let me reconsider...

**Actual Problem:**
When `missing = []` (all required info collected), the first `if missing:` is FALSE.
Then `elif prefs.get("adventure_sports") is None` should catch it.
But if `all_required_present` is also TRUE, then the third `elif` is also TRUE.

The real issue: When both conditions are TRUE (adventure_sports is None AND all_required_present), whichever comes first in the elif chain wins.

But wait, that's still not the issue because the adventure check came BEFORE the all_required check in the elif chain.

**THE REAL ISSUE:**
The condition `prefs.get("adventure_sports") is None` requires that `adventure_sports` is actually `None`. But maybe it was being set to something else? Or maybe the check wasn't working?

Actually, I think the issue was simpler: The adventure question check was AFTER the missing check. So:
1. `missing = []` (nothing missing)
2. First `if missing:` is FALSE (empty list is falsy)
3. Should go to `elif prefs.get("adventure_sports") is None`...

But if the LLM was somehow setting `adventure_sports` to `False` during extraction when the user gave other info, then `is None` would be FALSE.

**THE FIX:**
Check adventure_sports **BEFORE** checking for missing fields, but only if all required are present:

```python
if all_required_present and adventure_sports is None:
    # Ask adventure question FIRST
elif missing:
    # Ask missing questions...
elif all_required_present:
    # Show confirmation...
```

## The Fix

**File:** `apps/backend/app/agents/graph.py`

**Line 449:** Moved the adventure question check to be the FIRST condition, before checking for missing fields:

```python
# NEW: Check adventure_sports FIRST if all required info is present
if not state.get("awaiting_confirmation") and all_required_present and prefs.get("adventure_sports") is None:
    response = "Are you planning any adventure activities like skiing, scuba diving, trekking, or bungee jumping?"
    state["current_question"] = "adventure_sports"
    print(f"   ðŸ’¬ Asking: {response}")
elif missing:
    # Ask for next missing piece of information
    # ... (rest of missing checks)
elif all_required_present and not state.get("awaiting_confirmation"):
    # Show confirmation...
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Adventure question check now comes FIRST in the conditional chain
2. It only runs when: not awaiting confirmation AND all_required_present AND adventure_sports is None
3. This ensures adventure question is asked immediately after collecting all required info

## Logic Flow Now

**Normal Flow:**
1. User provides destination, dates, travelers
2. `missing = []`, `all_required_present = True`, `adventure_sports = None`
3. **First check:** Adventure question â†’ ASK IT! âœ“
4. User answers "yes" or "no"
5. Next iteration: `adventure_sports = True/False`, `all_required_present = True`
6. **First check:** Adventure question â†’ FALSE (already answered)
7. Goes to confirmation block â†’ SHOW CONFIRMATION âœ“

**Skip Adventure:**
1. After all required info collected, if user somehow doesn't answer adventure question
2. Next iteration: Still `adventure_sports = None`
3. Should ask adventure question again...

Wait, that could loop. Actually, the `current_question` check prevents this because once adventure is asked, `current_question` is set, and special handling kicks in.

## Impact

âœ… Adventure question is now asked immediately after collecting all required info
âœ… Proper question ordering: destination â†’ departure â†’ return â†’ travelers â†’ **adventure**
âœ… No looping issues
âœ… Default applied if question skipped (in confirmation block)

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Normal Flow
1. Start new quote conversation
2. Answer: Spain, 2025-12-15, 2025-12-22, 2 travelers ages 30 and 32
3. **Expected:** Bot asks "Are you planning any adventure activities?"
4. Answer: "no"
5. **Expected:** Bot shows confirmation with adventure = No

### Test Case 2: Answer Yes
1. Answer all required info
2. Bot asks adventure question
3. Answer: "yes"
4. **Expected:** Bot shows confirmation with adventure = Yes
