# How to Diagnose the Loop Issue

## Current Problem

After answering questions like "no" to adventure sports, chatbot responds with "How else can I help you today?" instead of progressing to confirmation or quotes.

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Backend Logs

Look for these log patterns in your backend terminal:

```
üîÄ ORCHESTRATOR (iteration X)
Intent: <intent> (confidence: X.XX)
üîÄ Routing #X: intent=<intent>
   ‚Üí <where>
```

**Key things to look for:**
- What intent is being classified?
- What route is being chosen?
- Is `requires_human` being set to True?

### 2. Expected Flow After "no"

When user says "no" to adventure sports:

1. `needs_assessment` processes "no"
2. Sets `prefs["adventure_sports"] = False`
3. Sets `current_question = ""`
4. Should detect `all_required_present = True` and `adventure_answered = True`
5. Should go to lines 543-570 (confirmation)
6. Show confirmation message
7. Set `awaiting_confirmation = True`

### 3. What Might Be Going Wrong

**Scenario A: Intent classification**
- "no" might be getting classified as `human_handoff` or low confidence
- This sets `requires_human = True`
- Routes to `customer_service`

**Scenario B: State not being preserved**
- Checkpointer might not be preserving `trip_details`, `travelers_data`, etc.
- This causes `all_required_present` to be False
- Bot thinks info is missing and loops

**Scenario C: Logic bug**
- One of the conditions in `needs_assessment` is not being met
- Bot doesn't know what to do next
- Falls through to some default behavior

### 4. Quick Test

Add this debug logging to see what's happening:

In `apps/backend/app/agents/graph.py` around line 537:

```python
print(f"   üîç DEBUG STATE:")
print(f"      trip_details: {trip}")
print(f"      travelers_data: {travelers}")
print(f"      preferences: {prefs}")
print(f"      awaiting_confirmation: {state.get('awaiting_confirmation')}")
print(f"      all_required_present: {all_required_present}")
print(f"      adventure_answered: {prefs.get('adventure_sports') is not None}")
```

### 5. What You Need to Do

**RESTART THE BACKEND** and watch the logs carefully when you answer "no".

The logs will tell us:
- Where the graph is routing
- What state it has
- Why it's going wrong

## Likely Root Cause

Based on the loop behavior, I suspect:
- Either intent classification is wrong
- Or state is being lost/reset somewhere

The checkpointer should preserve state automatically, but something might be interfering.

## Action Required

**RESTART BACKEND** and share the backend logs from when you test the "no" response.
