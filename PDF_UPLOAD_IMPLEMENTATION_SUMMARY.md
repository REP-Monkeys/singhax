# PDF Upload & OCR Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All core functionality for PDF upload, OCR extraction, JSON generation, and policy recommendation has been successfully implemented.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. PDF Upload Button ✅
- **Location**: `apps/frontend/src/app/app/quote/page.tsx`
- PDF upload button added next to voice and send buttons
- Supports PDF, PNG, JPEG formats
- File size validation (10MB max)
- Loading state during upload
- Error handling

### 2. Document Type Detection ✅
- **Location**: `apps/backend/app/services/ocr/document_detector.py`
- LLM-based document type detection (not hardcoded)
- Detects: flight_confirmation, hotel_booking, itinerary, visa_application
- Returns confidence scores and reasoning

### 3. JSON Extraction Service ✅
- **Location**: `apps/backend/app/services/ocr/json_extractor.py`
- Type-specific extraction with confidence scoring
- Confidence thresholds:
  - ≥0.90 (High): Auto-include
  - 0.80-0.89 (Medium): Include but flag for confirmation
  - <0.80 (Low): Ask user to manually input
- Saves JSON files to `uploads/documents/`
- Filters fields by confidence level

### 4. Enhanced Upload Endpoint ✅
- **Location**: `apps/backend/app/routers/chat.py`
- Auto-processes PDFs immediately upon upload
- OCR → Document Type Detection → JSON Extraction → Auto-process via graph
- Returns structured extraction results
- Integrates with chat conversation flow

### 5. Policy Recommendation Service ✅
- **Location**: `apps/backend/app/services/policy_recommender.py`
- Based on POLICY_DECISION_CRITERIA_ANALYSIS.md
- Decision logic for:
  - Pre-existing conditions → TravelEasy Pre-Ex or Standard
  - Age 70+ → TravelEasy Standard (single trip)
  - Scoot airline → Scootsurance
  - Annual coverage → TravelEasy Standard
  - Adventure sports → Elite/Premier tiers
- Returns recommendation with reasoning

### 6. Document Processing Node ✅
- **Location**: `apps/backend/app/agents/graph.py`
- Enhanced `process_document` node
- Extracts trip information from OCR text
- Sets confirmation flag
- Integrates with existing conversation flow

### 7. Confirmation UI Component ✅
- **Location**: `apps/frontend/src/components/ExtractedDataCard.tsx`
- Beautiful card displaying extracted information
- Shows document type
- Displays key fields (destination, dates, travelers, etc.)
- Highlights low-confidence fields
- Three action buttons: Confirm, Edit, Reject
- Editable mode support

### 8. Frontend Confirmation Flow ✅
- **Location**: `apps/frontend/src/app/app/quote/page.tsx`
- ExtractedDataCard integrated into chat messages
- Confirmation buttons trigger API calls
- Seamless chat interface - everything in one place
- Auto-updates conversation state

2. File uploaded to /api/v1/chat/upload-image
   ↓
3. OCR extracts text from PDF/image
   ↓
4. Document type detected (LLM-based)
   ↓
5. Structured JSON extracted (type-specific)
   ↓
6. JSON saved to uploads/documents/{session_id}_{type}_{timestamp}.json
   ↓
7. Document auto-processed via graph

```

## 🎨 User Experience

1. **Upload**: Click PDF button → Select file → Processing...
2. **Extraction**: Agent processes document → Shows extracted info in card
3. **Confirmation**: Review data → Click "Confirm" → Policy recommended
4. **Quote**: Auto-generates quote based on confirmed information

## 🔧 Configuration

### Confidence Thresholds
- **High**: 0.90 (auto-include)
- **Medium**: 0.80-0.89 (flag for confirmation)
- **Low**: <0.80 (ask user to input manually)

### File Limits
- **Max size**: 10MB
- **Supported formats**: PDF, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP

## 📊 JSON File Structure

Each document type has its own JSON structure (see `DOCUMENT_JSON_STRUCTURES.md`):
- Flight Confirmation: Airlines, dates, travelers, ticket costs
- Hotel Booking: Check-in/out, location, investment value
- Itinerary: Activities, destinations, risk factors
- Visa Application: Trip purpose, duration, applicant info

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Normalized Merger**: Merge multiple documents into unified structure
2. **Full Type-Specific Prompts**: Complete prompts for hotel, itinerary, visa extraction
3. **Adventure Sports Detection**: LLM-based detection (foundation ready)
4. **Multi-Document Support**: Handle multiple uploads in one session
5. **Enhanced Policy Matching**: Match to specific policy documents

## ⚠️ Notes

- Groq API doesn't support `response_format` parameter, so JSON is parsed from text responses
- Some type-specific extractors use simplified prompts (can be enhanced)
- Normalized merger service not yet implemented (works with single documents)
- Policy recommendation uses basic logic (can be enhanced with more criteria)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
